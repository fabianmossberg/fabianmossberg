<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm Fabian</h1>
<h3 align="center">I like smart things.</h3>

<p>I've been coding since i was a kid. Built my first website before CSS existed. In my spare time I am playing with old macintosh computers.</p>

<p>I love exploring how technology can enhance our lives, both at an individual level, and as a society. There is a lot happening in the blockchain space. I am a firm believer that Web3 is bringing a huge change to the world.</p>

## What I love
