<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Fabian</h1>
<h3 align="center">I like smart things.</h3>

I've been coding since i was a kid. Built my first website before CSS existed. In my spare time I am playing with old Macintosh computers.

I love exploring how technology can enhance our lives, both at an individual level, and as a society.

I like building tools that improves life and automates manual tasks. I usually spend <em>more time</em> on building automations for tasks, than I will actually save from automating them.

There is <em>one thing</em> that has really brought back the joy of coding to me in the last years, and it's <strong>[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)</strong>. If you haven't looked at it, you should go do the [tutorial](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics), and have your mind blown.

## Things I want to master

## Stuff I love

| What                                                  | Why?                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit)         | *The* application framework for **Svelte**                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte)          | Beautiful, efficient, easy to learn. A whole new take on how we build things. The video that got me hooked was [rethinking reactivity](https://youtu.be/AdNJ3fydeao) by [@Rich-Harris](https://github.com/Rich-Harris) |
| [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/postgres/postgres)    | I was wrong when I thought it's just an alternative to MySQL.                                                                                                                                                          |
| Marley                                                | He's my dog 🐩                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [Supabase](https://github.com/supabase/supabase)      | Open source project that gives you a Postgres Database, Authentication, instant APIs, realtime subscriptions and Storage 🤯                                                                                             |
| [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) | I jumped on this train not too long ago. A great way to improve the quality of my code!                                                                                                                                |
| [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)        | Like [vim](https://github.com/vim/vim), but made by Microsoft.                                                                                                                                                        |
